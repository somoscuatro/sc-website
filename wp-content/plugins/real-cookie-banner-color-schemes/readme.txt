With the Color schemes add on for Real Cookie Banner you can setup the colors for the single objects in Groups. You don't have to go through all sections anymore.

== Description ==
Color schemes is an add on for the Real Cookie Banner plugin, which I found the best cookie consent plugin, especially for the german market. Real Cookie Banner is quite complex with a lot of design options. If you want to assign a set of colors to the buttons and links you have to go through many sections with a lot settings. There is no option to change for example all button colors at once. This is what Color schemes does. It offers a single section only for the color settings. There you can setup a primary color, a secondary color, text colors and link colors. Color schemes changes the colors from the assigned objects. If you want to change a single color afterwards, you can easily do that inside the standard sections from Real Cookie Banner.

== Installation ==
Plugin: Real Cookie Banner from devowl.io needed. Has to be installed and activated first.
After installation there is a new section inside the Cookie Banner panel inside the customizer, called Color schemes.
